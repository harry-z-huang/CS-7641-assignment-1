Didn't realize this assignment was due sunday night and not monday, thats why I skipped the analysis on the second dataset. 

Simply download the CSVs and jupyter notebook into the same directory and run the cells. 
A .py file is also available in case you want to run the code as a whole. 

You'll need to have installed the following libraries. Just run "pip install _____", where ____ represents the library:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
sklearn

To make life easier for you...

pip install pandas

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install numpy

pip install sklearn
